Sample files of my work on a family tree mobile app

For this project, I created a server and client architecture for an Android app that served as a family tree. Users could create accounts, add members of their family, and add notable events in ancestor's lives. There were also settings and search functionalities. The server utilized Java and the client utilized Java and XML.
